# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: 02 July, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Created a clock in React.

**Thoughts:** I am actually pretty proud of the design I made for this. Could probably improve on it, but I need to improve my CSS skills.

### Day 6: 01 July, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Caesar Cipher. Actually made the github for this and started this log. Better late than never?

**Thoughts:** What'd I tell ya? My code may be an ugly spaghetti monstrosity, but it does what it should do so I'm happy. Also realized I should have started this at the beginning. 

I put a folder called 2022June, which is the year and month I started this. I'll keep the projects I create in this folder as well as this log. However, to make things a little neater, I'll also post the link down below.

### Day 5: 30 June, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started work on a Caesar Cipher using React.

**Thoughts:** Failed horribly. Thought I had the basics down, but it hasn't really sunk in yet. That's alright though. Failure is only the first step on the path to success.

### Day 4: 29 June, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished the React tutorial at https://www.kirupa.com/react/index.htm. 

**Thoughts:** Redux confused me. I will need to spend some time going over it, but first I will practice React. Crawl before you walk. Walk before you run.  

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 3: 28 June, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Worked through the React tutorial at https://www.kirupa.com/react/index.htm. Created a Single Page Application using React Routes.

**Thoughts:** Finally got to see how React comes together. It will take me some time to figure out how everything fits and especially to replicate the tutorials on my own.

### Day 1: 26 June, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Worked through the React tutorial at https://www.kirupa.com/react/index.htm

**Thoughts:** I tried the official React docs first, but this is easier to follow and understand. It breaks React down to small bite-sized chunks.
