# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 13: 08 July, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Created login screen. Created user list. Implemented routing.

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure if I implemented the routing properly. It works, but it looks a bit messy. Front end is almost fully built now.

### Day 12: 07 July, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Adjusted design of overall app. Changed color of chat elements. Created chat bubbles and moved chat to bottom right of chat window.

**Thoughts:** Got to a place I feel is a good jumping off point for Front End. Need to add a login screen next so users can specify a username. Won't be doing authentication or storing messages right now. Will get that stuff up and running once the backend is built.

### Day 11: 06 July, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started work on a chat app.

**Thoughts:** Had to do some trickery by making a div element editable. Input Text doesn't allow multiline text and textarea wouldn't center vertically for me. Other than that, I think I have a good thing going for this.

### Day 10: 05 July, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished first build of Monty Hall.

**Thoughts:** Had some trouble getting events to pass correctly and figuring out how to reference a component without referencing the event. Got something that works though.

### Day 9: 04 July, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Began working on a Monty Hall Problem Demonstration.

**Thoughts:** Didn't get as much done today. Also didn't like the first build of this program. Will try again tomorrow.

### Day 8: 03 July, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Added a Promodoro Timer to the Clock.

**Thoughts:** Beginning to get the hang of React I think. I already see ways I can improve my code. I could probably make the timer a top level element and just pass data to it based on what program is active. That would allow me to be more precise with CSS formatting and clean up some duplicate code and formatting. Really not taking advantage of props at all.

### Day 7: 02 July, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Created a clock in React.

**Thoughts:** I am actually pretty proud of the design I made for this. Could probably improve on it, but I need to improve my CSS skills.

### Day 6: 01 July, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Caesar Cipher. Actually made the github for this and started this log. Better late than never?

**Thoughts:** What'd I tell ya? My code may be an ugly spaghetti monstrosity, but it does what it should do so I'm happy. Also realized I should have started this at the beginning. 

I put a folder called 2022June, which is the year and month I started this. I'll keep the projects I create in this folder as well as this log. However, to make things a little neater, I'll also post the link down below.

### Day 5: 30 June, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started work on a Caesar Cipher using React.

**Thoughts:** Failed horribly. Thought I had the basics down, but it hasn't really sunk in yet. That's alright though. Failure is only the first step on the path to success.

### Day 4: 29 June, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished the React tutorial at https://www.kirupa.com/react/index.htm. 

**Thoughts:** Redux confused me. I will need to spend some time going over it, but first I will practice React. Crawl before you walk. Walk before you run.

### Day 3: 28 June, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Worked through the React tutorial at https://www.kirupa.com/react/index.htm. Created a Single Page Application using React Routes.

**Thoughts:** Finally got to see how React comes together. It will take me some time to figure out how everything fits and especially to replicate the tutorials on my own.

### Day 2: 27 June, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Worked through the React tutorial at https://www.kirupa.com/react/index.htm

**Thoughts:** Nothing crazy exiciting today.

### Day 1: 26 June, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Worked through the React tutorial at https://www.kirupa.com/react/index.htm

**Thoughts:** I tried the official React docs first, but this is easier to follow and understand. It breaks React down to small bite-sized chunks.
